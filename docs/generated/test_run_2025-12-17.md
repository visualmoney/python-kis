# Full Test Run with Coverage (2025-12-17)

- Command: `poetry run pytest -v` (pytest addopts from pyproject applied: coverage + HTML/XML/JUnit reports under `reports/`)
- Outcome: 810 passed, 32 skipped, 7 warnings; duration 46.12s
- Coverage: 94% total (reports saved to `reports/coverage_html/` and `reports/coverage.xml`)
- Reports: `reports/test_report.html`, `reports/junit_report.xml`, `reports/coverage_html/`, `reports/coverage.xml`
- Warnings: deprecation in `tests/unit/api/account/test_pending_order.py` (use `KisOrder.from_number/from_order`); user warnings from event tickets auto-unsubscribe in `tests/unit/client/test_websocket.py`
- Notes: Initial VS Code task (python -m poetry install) failed due to missing poetry module; reran with `poetry run pytest -v` successfully. Environment: Poetry 2.1.2, Python 3.11.9 (pyproject addopts handled coverage outputs).
